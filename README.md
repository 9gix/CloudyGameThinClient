# CloudyGameThinClient
This is an application that the player uses to play the game. The player will receive an input video stream from the cloud servers, and send their keyboard and mouse inputs to the servers via this application.

## Prerequisites for using the Python Thin Client 
### pygame
1. Obtain the .whl file for your Python version [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame). There are 32-bit and 64-bit files, so ensure that is correct as well.
2. Open the terminal, and navigate to where you placed your .whl file. Type `pip install filename.whl`. Replace the filename with the correct one.
